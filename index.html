  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>Weclome! Over the years my philosophy in life has changed a bit. I used to be a perfectionist with all the stress that goes along with it. Now don't get me wrong, I still have that drive within me today. The difference is that now, I have learned to temper it. I am thrilled if what I have done turns out to be really good. Respect and learning through our experiences is so important! Thank you for visiting. Send me a message, it would be great to hear from you.</p>
