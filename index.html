    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
      <p>
        Over the years my philosophy in life has changed a bit. I used to be a perfectionist with all the stress that goes along with that. Now don't get me wrong, I still have that perfectionist drive within me today. I've just learned when it's time to say... "Done!"<br><br>
        Currently I am learning Frontend Web Development. Here is my <a href="https://shawnstallings.github.io/shawnstallings-portfolio">Web Developer Portfolio</a>, if you would like to check out my work. Thank you for visiting! Send me a message, it would be great to hear from you.
